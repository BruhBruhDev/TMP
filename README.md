# TMP

WILL FINISH THE DESC LATER  . . . . . .. 


Whats the aim of TMP?
  It was designed by me initally for personal use only and had just the console as ui. I was annoyed that my laptop would constantly be at his temperature limits, with the fans reving at its maximum rotational momentum, creating noise and making me the center of attention.
  I decided open source share
  Everything is tested on my laptop I decided



How does is it implemented?
 its completely friendly taco

works by using windows powerplans
no networking
no responsability
cpu modification


If you find any bugs feel free to create an issue


btw TMP stands for Temperature Management Program. Very basic, I know XD
